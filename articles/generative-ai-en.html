										From its inception as simple rule-based systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has developed substantially today into more complex societies that we can correlate with our daily lives. Of the many fields within AI research that exist today, one area stands out - Generative AI.
										<br>
										It emphasizes developing machines so they may be capable of producing new material such as images and music and even things like news - how remarkable!
										<br>
										Generative AI classifies under Machine Learning; this involves using specialized approaches such as generative modeling techniques while capturing unique distribution patterns present in previously available data sets for generating fresh datasets simulating their pattern features.
									</p>
									<p>
										The most popular generative model in recent years is undoubtedly Ian Goodfellow's 2014 idea of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of two neural networks: one that generates data & another assessing generations for plausibility against original 'real' samples. These two models train collaboratively by learning from every iteration sample presented on each side as either "Real" or "Fake".  
									</p>
									<p>
										The generator continually aims at deceiving the discriminator model while it strives at accurately identifying authenticity based on unique characteristics within individually created datasets – amazing, right? These cutting-edge models have been applied to generate realistic images, music and even human-like text, as seen in OpenAI's GPT-3 that have been developed to GPT-4 which is cross-modality, this means that GPT-4 can deal with text, images, etc...).  
									</p>
									<p>
										Operating on a feature-rich model that has demonstrated the potential for generating compelling outputs like written articles, fictional stories and even awe-inspiring poetry! The scientifically inclined also stand to benefit from its vast potential applications range — drug testing to molecular generation, simulating complex systems with remarkable outcomes. 
									</p>
									<p>
										However, generative AI also raises ethical concerns, particularly around the potential misuse of generated content. For example, GANs could be used to create fake news or propaganda, or to generate deepfakes that could be used to manipulate public opinion. 
									</p>
									<p>
										To address these concerns, researchers are working on developing techniques to detect and prevent the misuse of generative AI. For example, some researchers are developing methods to watermark generated content to make it easier to identify if it has been manipulated. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In conclusion, generative AI is a rapidly evolving field with many exciting possibilities. While there are ethical concerns that need to be addressed, the potential benefits of generative AI are enormous. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see more and more applications of generative AI in our daily lives.
									</p>
									<p>
										we will explain Generative AI algorithms in later articles.
