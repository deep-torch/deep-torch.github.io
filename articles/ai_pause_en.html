									<p>Andrew Ng and Yann LeCun conversation<br />
										About the calling for AI research pause<br />

									<p >
										On 22 March, an open letter is published, calling on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.
									</p>
									<p>
										This letter came as a result of the huge and rapid advance of AI systems, especially GPT-4. 
										<br />
										They fear that AI will cause harm to society in an irreversable way because we do not fully understand what it does and the lack of safety protocols for developing these systems. 
									</p>
									<div >
										<p >
											The most notable people that signed on this letter are:
										</p>
										<ol style="padding-right: 4%;">
											<li>Elon Musk (CEO of SpaceX, Tesla & Twitter)</li>
											<li>Yoshua Bengio (Turing Prize winner and an AI pioneer)</li>
										</ol>
									</div>
									
									<p >
										But do we really need that?
										Is that a good thing to do?
										Do we really reach AGI (Aritificial General Intelligence) that a lot of people fear? 
									</p>
									<div >
										<p >
											Two of the top AI researchers disagree with that.
										</p>
										<ol style="padding-right: 4%;">
											<li>Andrew Ng, which was a cofounder and head of Google Brain and was the former Chief Scientist at Baidu, and now he is an adjunct professor at Stanford University and Director of its Stanford AI Lab or SAIL.
												He is also the cofounder of both Coursera and deeplearning.ai </li>
											<li>Yann LeCun, Vice-President, Chief AI Scientist at Meta, Turing Award winner. 
											</li>
										</ol>
									</div>
									
									<p >
										They had a talk to discuss this letter, which we will talk about its main points. 
									</p>
									<p >
										They draw a line between pausing AI research and regulating AI products. They think that AI products that will be used by people in their daily life must be regulated to ensure safe use of this power. 
									</p>
									<p >
										In addition to that, , the idea of AI to "want" something, like dominating the humanity, is not possible, AI does not have its own goals, and motivations, we specify its objective when we train it, so as long as we do not do that explicitly this is not possible. 
									</p>
									<p >
										This hype rise since AI become in the hand of people, especially after the inegration of ChatGPT with Bing, which makes people more afraid from it, since they think that it is close to human level intelligence.
										<br />
										Yann explain how we, as humans, are very language oriented, because we think that when something is fluent it means that it is intelligent, but those systems have very superficial understanding of reality, which appears a lot when those models produce wrong facts that sounds true but it is not. 						
									</p>
									<p >
										They state that we are not close to human level intelligence yet. We don't even have self-drive cars yet. 									</p>
									<p >
										Nevertheless, nothing is perfect the first time it deployed, but without deploying it we can't predict all of its flaws, so instead of pausing we should pay attention more to releasing those product in a more controled environment to limit the range of any bad effects. 									</p>
									<p >
										We want to add that the fear from AI taking a lot of jobs from people is not realistic, because AI will assist us.
										<br />
										Of course there will be a lot of changes in the jobs, but this is an expected consequences for this big advancement.
										<br />
										Maybe in the near future it will be necessary that you are able to use these tools effectively, like what happened after
										Computer invention.
										<br />
										So instead of letting your fear controls you, you should learn how to use these tools to enhance your work, we use it for
										finding the information faster. Also, we used it to generate our logo as we previously said.
