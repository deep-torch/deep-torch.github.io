										A lot of people think that they are learning about AI by just learning some framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
										<br />
										They think they are making progress since they had managed to do some easy tasks (which look like magic at first), like standard classification in images.
									</p>
									<p>
										But their progress will hit a wall after learning the basics.
										<br />
										Since AI is centred around math, and understanding some mathematical concepts is crucial to understand and develop AI models, and by understanding math, we do not mean memorising some formulas. It is about concepts and intuition.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>But why do we need maths?</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										First of all,Â when we say AI models we mean mathematical models that learn through optimizing a cost function.
										<br />
										Usually, they consist of a deterministic function (to extract the features) and a probability distribution over the possible outputs.
So, it is crucial to know the main concepts of probability.
									</p>
									<p>
										Also, we use a cost function to measure how good the model is, and we should know the mathematical properties of the function to know if it is good for our case or not.
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition to that, when using backpropagation for gradient descent we should have some familiarity with derivatives and their properties, so that we can identify if the problem is something related to the flow of the gradient through the network. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Linear algebra is also required since we are dealing with high dimensional spaces and a lot of linear transformations.
										<br />
										Even when using non linearity functions, we do some analysis by simplifying to the linear case. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In general, we should be good at probability, linear algebra, and calculus.
									</p>
									<p>
										We will have a lot of educational content on mathematics for AI, so <e>stay tuned!</e>
