                                        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning paradigms are different approaches or techniques used to train machines to learn from data.
                                        <br />
                                        These paradigms include supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Understanding these paradigms is important for developing efficient and accurate machine learning models that can be applied to various fields such as healthcare, finance, and the automotive industry.
                                    </p>
									<p>
										This article will provide an overview of the different machine learning paradigms along with their subcategories, advantages, disadvantages, and applications.
									</p>

									<h2>Supervised Learning Paradigm</h2>
									<h3>Definition of Supervised Learning</h3>
									<p>
										Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm in which a model is given a set of labelled data (input and output) and learns to make predictions based on that data.
										<br />
                                        The model is trained on a set of examples that are labelled with the correct output, which means the model will learn to link between input and output throughout this data, and then tested on new, unlabeled data (without output) to see how well it performs.
                                    </p>
									<h3>Types of Supervised Learning</h3>
                                    <p>
										There are two main types of supervised learning: regression and classification. Regression is used to predict a continuous value, while classification is used to predict a discrete value or category. 
                                	</p>
									<h3>Applications of Supervised Learning </h3>
									<p >
										Supervised learning has a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. For example, a model could use supervised learning to predict which stocks will perform well in the future based on an analysis of historical market data. 
									</p>

									<h2>Unsupervised Learning Paradigm </h2>
									<h3>Definition of Unsupervised Learning</h3>
									<p>
										Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm in which a computer system is given a set of unlabeled data and learns to identify patterns or groupings on its own. Unlike supervised learning, there is no correct answer, and the system must find its own way to make sense of the data.
									</p>

									<h3>Types of Unsupervised Learning</h3>
									<p>
										Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction: 
										<ul>
											<li>
												Clustering is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences.
											</li>
											<li>
												Association is another type of unsupervised learning method that uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given dataset.  
											</li>
											<li>
												Dimensionality reduction is a learning technique used when the number of features (or dimensions) in a given dataset is, too high. 
											</li>
										</ul>
									</p>

									<h3>Applications of Unsupervised Learning </h3>
									<p>
										Unsupervised learning has applications in areas such as anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and market segmentation. For example, a system could use unsupervised learning to group customers with similar purchasing habits together for targeted advertising campaigns. 
									</p>

									<h2>Reinforcement Learning Paradigm </h2>
									<h3>Definition of Reinforcement Learning </h3>
									<p>
										Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with its environment by performing actions and observing the consequences of those actions. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, and its goal is to learn how to take actions that maximize the reward
									</p>

									<h3>Process of Reinforcement Learning </h3>
									<p>
										The process of reinforcement learning starts with an agent in a certain state, which takes an action based on its current policy. The environment responds to the action, and the agent receives a reward or punishment. The agent then updates its policy based on the experience, and the process repeats until the agent has learned the optimal policy. 
									</p>

									<h3>Applications of Reinforcement Learning </h3>
									<p>
										Reinforcement learning has many practical applications, including robotics, game playing, and recommendation systems.
										<br />
										For example, reinforcement learning can be used to train a robot to perform tasks such as grasping and manipulation, and it has been used to create expert-level game playing agents for games like chess and Go. It can also be used to create personalized recommendation systems that learn from user behavior and feedback. 
									</p>

										<b>Is this all about machine learning paradigms?</b>
										<br />
										No, there is more, and we will talk about it in later articles!
